# Monitor bank for the 6502-Retro

The purpose of this rom bank is to provide a very simple interface to the system
that can be used for debugging, uploading data into arbirtry points in RAM,
executing them and generally being a nuisance.

The primary reason for it is the uploading data into arbitrary parts of ram.
This will be very useful for when I need to work on the operating system in bank
0 and want to load it into high memory for testing.
